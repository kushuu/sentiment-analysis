# sentiment-analyzer
- Here I've used data from sentdex (https://pythonprogramming.net/static/downloads/short_reviews/) for training my models.
- Various ML algorithms have been used to classify text.
- The final verdict is given on the basis of votes from all of the models.
- The mode of those votes is the final class of text.
- A confidence measure is also implemented.
